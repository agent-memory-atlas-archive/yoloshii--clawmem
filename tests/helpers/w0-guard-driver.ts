/**
 * Subprocess driver for the zero-weight failure-guard regression test at the
 * REAL handler (codex turn-19 finding 3). RERANK_LANE_WEIGHT is baked into
 * surfacing-fusion.ts at module import, so the w=0 handler path can only be
 * exercised in a fresh process with CLAWMEM_RERANK_LANE_WEIGHT set by the
 * spawner BEFORE this file's imports resolve. Same store-boundary stub
 * surface as hook-lanes.integration.test.ts; the spawning test parses the
 * single W0DRIVER:: line from stdout.
 *
 * Scenario: full reranker coverage over the pool + an expansion-only,
 * gate-FAILING candidate (shares no vocabulary with the prompt).
 *  - weight 0 (lane inert): usable arbitration is absent -> dropUnarbitrated
 *    must run -> the junk is dropped. Regressing the guard to the old
 *    coverage-arbitrates form (skip on rerankBlended alone) injects it.
 *  - default weight (control): usable arbitration present -> guard skipped
 *    -> the junk IS injected (banded last) — proving the pool genuinely
 *    carries it to the guard, so its absence at w=0 is the guard's doing.
