/**
 * Subprocess driver for the per-request degeneracy gate at the REAL handler
 * (BUILD-3d). RERANK_DEGENERACY_GATE_ACTIVE is baked into
 * surfacing-fusion.ts at module import, so the gate-off control arm can only
 * be exercised in a fresh process with CLAWMEM_RERANK_DEGENERACY_GATE set by
 * the spawner BEFORE this file's imports resolve. Same store-boundary stub
 * surface as w0-guard-driver.ts; the spawning test parses the single
 * DGDRIVER:: line from stdout.
 *
 * Scenario: full reranker coverage with a CONSTANT score set (spread 0 —
 * the inert regime) over a pool carrying an expansion-only, gate-FAILING
 * candidate.
 *  - default (gate on): the assessment fires and the ACTION discards the
 *    lane -> orderingApplied false, rankingKey "rrf", dropUnarbitrated runs
 *    -> the junk is dropped. Regressing the discard (apply ordering despite
 *    a degenerate verdict) injects it and flips orderingApplied.
 *  - CLAWMEM_RERANK_DEGENERACY_GATE=off (control): the SAME scores are
 *    assessed (shadow — gated:false, degenerate:true still recorded) but
 *    the action is disarmed -> arbitration present -> the junk IS injected.
 *    The toggle is the only difference between the arms.
