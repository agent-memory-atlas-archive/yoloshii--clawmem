/**
 * Context-surfacing provenance trace — the per-stage diagnostics envelope
 * (RANKING-DEFECT-HANDOFF Addendum 5, BUILD-0 / CONTRACT-5).
 *
 * One `SurfacingTrace` records everything a single `contextSurfacing`
 * invocation did: which retrieval legs ran, every candidate's raw channel
 * score + rank at insertion, rerank coverage, per-document composite scores,
 * the admission decision, post-admission reorders, and the final injected
 * order. It exists so ranking diagnosis reads ground truth instead of
 * inferring cause from final output — the Addendum 4 mis-diagnosis
 * (spreading-activation-over-hubs) happened precisely because no per-stage
 * record existed.
 *
 * The trace is OBSERVATION ONLY: collecting it never changes retrieval,
 * ranking, admission, or output. The handler populates it when (a) the
 * caller passes one in (the hook replay-eval harness), or (b)
 * CLAWMEM_SURFACING_TRACE=1 asks the live hook to persist envelopes into
 * `surfacing_diagnostics` for post-hoc diagnosis.
 *
 * Forward-looking fields (`rankingKey`, `TraceCandidate.lane`) are part of
 * the envelope contract now so the BUILD-1..5 invariant checkers have a
 * stable schema to key on; today's handler records the current behavior
 * (`rankingKey: "composite"`, no lanes) truthfully.
