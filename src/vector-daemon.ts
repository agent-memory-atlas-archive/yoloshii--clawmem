/**
 * Vector-query daemon (BACKLOG Source 46) — HARD cap on the cold synchronous sqlite-vec MATCH.
 *
 * The context-surfacing UserPromptSubmit hook runs a SYNCHRONOUS sqlite-vec MATCH (searchVecMatch).
 * bun:sqlite exposes no interrupt/progress handler, so a cold scan on a large vault blocks the hook's
 * single event loop past its 8-15s budget — an in-thread `Promise.race(vectorTimeout)` cannot fire
 * while a synchronous call runs. This daemon relocates the MATCH — and, since v0.38's hydrated-v1
 * protocol (codex #28 t83–t88), the hydration + snippet PROJECTION too — onto the long-lived
 * watcher process: the hook sends the query + presentation inputs over a per-vault unix socket and
 * races the reply against a REAL setTimeout (its own event loop stays free); the daemon answers with
 * fully projected results, so the hook performs ZERO synchronous sqlite inside its vector deadline.
 * Client-side hydration survives only on the raw-hit path: a request that never asked for hydration,
 * answered by a current daemon that attested the budget it enforced. A legacy daemon's raw answer to
 * a hydrated request carries no deadline attestation and is classified `skew` (FTS) — O1 §4
 * superseded the t84 raw-hit negotiation.
 *
 * The daemon is a strict OPTIMIZATION LAYER, never a dependency:
 *   - daemon absent/refused  → the hook uses the in-process searchVec path UNCHANGED (today's behavior;
 *                              users who don't run the watcher lose nothing).
 *   - daemon busy/error/timeout → the hook returns [] and falls back to FTS (it must NOT re-run the scan
 *                              in-process, which would reintroduce the very block this exists to avoid).
 *
 * Design record: BACKLOG.md Source 46 "DESIGN-gate outcome + build contract" (2026-07-05, codex-cleared).
