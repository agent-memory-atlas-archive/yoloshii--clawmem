/**
 * Session-scoped pre-compaction state (62.2 — CM-01, CM-04, CM-05, NEW-2).
 *
 * `precompact-extract` (PreCompact) stores ONE session's state; `postcompact-inject` (SessionStart,
 * source "compact") takes it for that session only, once.
 *
 * Through v0.39.1 the state was ONE `precompact-state.md` per project directory, written into Claude
 * Code's auto-memory dir and read by any SessionStart: every session in the directory received the
 * last compaction of whichever session compacted most recently, and a PreCompact that extracted
 * nothing left the older file in place to be replayed later.
 *
 * The state lives in the vault's `compaction_state` table, one row per session id. SQLite supplies
 * what a file protocol would have to build: cross-process locking that the OS releases when a process
 * dies, and atomic compare-and-set. One thing the vault cannot supply is a write that succeeds while
 * the vault itself is busy, so each attempt is also REGISTERED outside it:
 *
 *   register  PreCompact's first act, before the vault is even opened: the session's registration, a
 *             row in a small database beside the vault, is replaced (one upsert) with a new attempt
 *             token. From that moment every earlier attempt is ineligible, even when the vault stays
 *             busy, the hook times out or the process dies.
 *   begin     PreCompact's first vault write replaces the session's row with that attempt and no payload,
 *             only while the attempt is still the registered one (checked under the write lock).
 *   complete  After extracting (outside any transaction), the payload is stored only if the row still
 *             carries THIS attempt: an older PreCompact that finishes after a newer one began stores
 *             nothing. A failed or empty extraction leaves the row without a payload: nothing to take.
 *   take      SessionStart(compact) consumes the registration (marks it consumed; the row stays), then
 *             deletes the row carrying the registered attempt whatever its state (`DELETE … RETURNING`,
 *             so of two concurrent takers exactly one gets it). A row still being extracted is deleted
 *             too, so its late completion stores nothing. A row carrying any other attempt is never
 *             taken. Last, the registration is read again: when the session's latest attempt is no
 *             longer the one consumed, a newer PreCompact registered while the delete waited for the
 *             vault (whether or not another take has consumed it since), and nothing is returned.
 *
 * Irreducible residual: a PreCompact whose disk refuses BOTH writes (the registration and the begin)
 * cannot mark anything stale. Then a previous state of the session that no SessionStart took stays
 * takeable until its TTL: no write-side mechanism can act when no write succeeds.
 *
 * Supported-host assumption: Claude Code sends the same `session_id` to PreCompact and to the
 * SessionStart(compact) that follows it. The hooks reference calls it the current session's id on both
 * events; observed pairs in `context_usage` agree. The host sends no compaction id, so a state is
 * bound to its compaction by the registration and a TTL.
 *
 * Every function here is fail-open and never throws.
