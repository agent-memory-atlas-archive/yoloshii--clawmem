/**
 * BUILD-5 t60/t61 (codex F59-1/F59-2, F60-2..5): post-output bookkeeping for
 * the context-surfacing hook, moved OFF the hook's blocking lifetime.
 *
 * The split (F59-2 + F60-2): the alignment/query-history context_usage row is
 * written synchronously at retrieval-commit time inside the handler (bounded
 * by the hook process's busy_timeout); when that write fails, the hook FAILS
 * THE INJECTION ("alignment-unavailable") rather than injecting an untracked
 * turn — so every job in this module belongs to a turn whose alignment row
 * exists. What lives here is genuinely optional learning bookkeeping: the
 * injected-paths/tokens UPDATE onto that row, recall events, and the
 * per-vault context_usage mirror.
 *
 * The handoff (F59-1 + F60-4): the handler never touches SQLite or the
 * filesystem after payload assembly — it parks ONE pending job in a module
 * slot. The CLI layer (clawmem.ts cmdHook), AFTER writing the hook output to
 * stdout, hands the job over a PIPE to a detached `clawmem spool-ingest`
 * child and exits; the CHILD persists the job to the spool directory next to
 * the store's database file and then drains. The hook process therefore
 * performs no post-stdout fs or SQLite work at all — a spool/DB stall blocks
 * the child, never hook output or hook exit. Durability window, stated
 * honestly: a job dies with the child if the child is killed BEFORE its
 * spool write lands; once spooled, it survives crashes and is drained by a
 * later turn's child.
 *
 * Idempotency (F60-3): every job carries an immutable jobId; drainer-written
 * recall events carry per-event dedupe keys enforced UNIQUE in storage
 * (INSERT OR IGNORE), so a retry after a partial apply never duplicates
 * events. Application is tracked per UNIT ("update", "general", one per
 * named vault as "vault:<encoded-name>") in the claim file, so retries skip completed units; a job is
 * deleted only when EVERY unit completed. Claims abandoned by a killed
 * drainer are reclaimed when their pid is dead. t62 (codex
 * F61-4): the vault MIRROR insert is idempotent too — it carries a
 * `${jobId}:${vault}:mirror` dedupe key enforced UNIQUE on context_usage,
 * and a retried insert returns the EXISTING mirror row's id — so a crash
 * between the mirror insert and that vault's events duplicates nothing on
 * reclaim.
 *
 * Validation (F60-5): a spooled job must pass the full structural check
 * below before any write; anything else is discarded as poison.
 *
 * Direct callers (the eval harness, tests) bypass the spool: they call
 * consumePendingSurfacingBookkeeping() + applySurfacingBookkeeping()
 * synchronously when they need the end-state, or simply ignore the slot.
