/**
 * Version tag of the RELATIVE-BUDGET deadline protocol on the daemon wire. A
 * request carries `remainingBudgetMs` (a whole count of milliseconds still
 * available to the leg, sampled immediately before the write) instead of an
 * absolute wall-clock `deadlineMs`; `performance.now()` origins are
 * per-process, so an absolute monotonic instant is meaningless to the
 * receiver, and an absolute wall instant is exactly the steppable quantity O1
 * removes. The CLIENT holds the authoritative timer; the daemon's deadline is
 * ADVISORY and trails the client by one-way transit (documented, not
 * corrected). A request still carrying `deadlineMs` is version skew and is
 * REFUSED without constructing a deadline from it.
 *
 * Orthogonal to `hydrated-v1` (daemon-side projection): both are advertised in
 * the readiness pong's `protocols`, and every scan response attests
 * `deadlineProtocol` so a client can tell a daemon that implements the
 * relative budget from one that silently ignored the field.

 * surfacing hook's supported maximum internal budget (`MAX_HOOK_BUDGET_MS`
 * re-exports it): a deep leg can inherit nearly the whole work window, so
 * a protocol ceiling below the largest supported hook budget would reject a
 * previously valid configuration as skew — the ceiling therefore covers
 * every supported budget, and an unsupported budget is refused BEFORE the
 * handler runs (`assertHookBudgetConfig`). 25_000 is a NEWLY SELECTED
 * interactive maximum borrowing the value of a shipped, model-bearing
